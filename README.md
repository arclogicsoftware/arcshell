# Training & Documentation

The training outlined below will be completed May 1, 2019. If you're interested in hosting onsite training contact us.

### Prerequisites

ArcShell should have very few if any prerequisites to get up and running. Besides a Bash or Korn shell ArcShell makes use of fairly standard Unix programs like awk, sed, bc, and perl.

It is recommended your servers have outbound email capability. If native email support is not possible ArcShell supports SendGrid. Other services can be added quickly upon request.

It is also recommended that the servers you are working with support SSH connections.
